Today's date is Wednesday the twenty fourth of June two thousand and nine and this is session six with therapist two zero one.  Okay, so the purpose of today's session is to record it for research purposes.  Thank you.  Okay, let's get going then.  You have a BGI score there, I guess.  Hmm?  Thirty-two.  Thirty-two, rats.  I was looking forward to that extra one being off.  So down to thirty-two.  Last week you were thirty-six.  Have you got any idea particularly about what the changes were?  Well, I think some of it was the way I was feeling last week and the previous week, really.  Yes.  Shall we have just a very brief look and just see which way you made the differences?  We'll do a compare one there from last week.  Yeah, if you like, yeah.  Shall we have a quick put that one down on the table, just out of interest?  I've got one.  Number one, I've got one.  Two, I've got one.  Three, I've got two.  Yeah, that's the same.  That's the same.  Yeah.  Four, I got two.  Yeah.  Five, one.  Ah, so that one's gone down, so that's good.  Yeah.  That was three last time, I think, wasn't it?  It was two.  Was it?  Might have been three the week before.  Six was nought.  Yeah.  Seven is one.  Okay, that was two last week.  Yeah.  That's good.  Eight is one.  Ah, that's another one.  That's good.  Yeah.  Nine is nought.  Wow, so that one's gone right up.  You were one last time.  That's interesting.  Yeah, so you've gone up some.  And more up.  And what about number twelve?  I'll put two to that today.  Oh, it's because last time you were three, so that's good.  Thirteen.  I've got three to that.  Yep.  And fourteen, I've got two.  Yeah.  And fifteen, I've got two.  Yeah.  And I think that was three last time.  Yep.  No, you were two last time.  Yeah, yeah.  And sixteen, I've got three B. Yep.  Because this morning I woke up at about five, and I lied there for a good couple of hours, and then I did manage to get to sleep, and I woke up at half nine, so... Mm-hmm.  It's been a pattern of waking up early.  At seventeen I put one.  Okay, you were two last time, so seventeen.  Question seventeen stands for one.  That's good.  Eighteen.  Well, I am eating more.  Yeah.  So I've got two meters up.  Okay.  Nineteen, I've got two.  Twenty, I've got two.  And last time you were three?  Yeah.  Was I?  Yeah.  I'm too tired.  Yeah, but I was feeling quite tired last time.  Question twenty-one.  It's the same as I had last time.  So what I'd like you to do, I think, future reference, I'd like to mention it last time, is perhaps if you keep a running commentary yourself on where the change is, because you've made some really good changes there.  I mean, briefly, I mean, obviously you've, Obviously, you've been doing some things very differently these last weeks, perhaps to get some of those results.  I mean, how has your week been?  Well, I think it's been better, really.  Because I've been thinking about it.  You know, what you said about how I was sort of thinking about all the things that were difficult and not concentrating on the things that I had been doing.  So you've been shifting the focus of your attention more?  I have.  Yes.  Not letting myself get so down, I think, really.  Right.  Well, I think that's really important.  And I wonder what we do today is have a bit of a review as to where we've got to in therapy so far and to think about some of these changes that you're making that have been improving your mood.  And then to think about, perhaps, what it is that we perhaps need to do kind of more of or where we're heading in therapy at the moment.  So we kind of sort of, session six, we haven't got any more booked in for the minute.  So it's good to sit and have a review, have a think perhaps, because we've kind of seen this sort of score go down and then up and then come down again.  And it'd be nice to think about bringing it down and not have these big kind of spikes.  So we need to make sure we focus our attention in the right places.  Is that okay?  Can I mention a couple of things that I wrote down?  Okay, yeah.  Because I wrote down increased confidence and self-esteem since I started wearing my new boots.  I need to address other things that I need to get.  You know, and I know what some of those things are.  What I'm going to suggest with this, because I think what you've written, Dan, you've been keeping a really thorough diary of things.  Well, I wish now, maybe, that I'd got a manuscript book and I'd written it all down page by page because I've got a lot of little bits and pieces.  Bits and pieces.  And it would have been easier to keep it all together, you know.  Something else I've thought about is that I don't have to be on the go all day or trying to be.  Because that's what I used to be.  I used to be trying to do things all day.  So if I sort of say finish at five o'clock and take time to relax, I mean if I sit down and read a magazine or something, or like you were saying, listen to someone on the radio, or when I get the TV, watch the TV a bit, and try to keep a regular pattern, starting at the same time each day, and finishing them at the same time each day, you know.  Right, what I'm going to do is call a halt there because you've told me some really good stuff and I'm afraid I'm going to lose it because I'm not making a note of it.  What I'm going to suggest we do is we do this in quite a formal way then because you have been making some really good discoveries and you may be making some really important changes and I want to get those down so that it makes sense to both of us as to why that's happening.  What I suggest that we do is Let's just take stock of how we can use this session to maximize what you've got today from the sessions by you telling me two to three important changes that you've made over the last six weeks.  You can refer back to what you're saying because what I'm going to do is I'm going to write them down as you talk.  Well, that is one of the things that you said to me about, you know, concentrate on the good things that I've been doing and not, you know, on the things that I've not been getting done.  So really focus on what?  rather than what I haven't.  Yeah.  Okay.  And that is another thing that I've thought about is, like I say, it's sort of, you know, starting at the same time every day and finishing at the same time every day.  So, you started off that bit of the session by saying it's something about the routine.  You realised you haven't got a routine, was it?  Or... Yeah, you know, another thing I didn't mention was that if I sort of, I mean you've talked about this before, but to write down the night before what I'm going to do the following day, and I think if I just give myself, you know, a couple of tasks to do, and you know, if I do It'll give me, I feel at the end that I've sort of achieved something now.  Okay.  I'm just, yeah, if I give myself tasks to do the following day, I think I might relax more doing a few things well and feel that I'm achieving something at the end of the day.  And then I could sort of look at it again at the end of the week.  Absolutely.  So a few things well that I can achieve.  Yeah.  Yes.  Absolutely.  Absolutely.  I would relax doing it.  So there's also something that you continue to say about being on the go all the time.  So there's planning for the day ahead, the night before, and that's essential to think of doing a few things well that I can achieve and reflect on, reflect back on.  Well, that's the thing.  It's trying to do things each day, but it's also important to say, you know... It's like when you've been out of work all day.  You come out and you don't want to start doing a lot of work around the house or something.  I mean, you want to relax, don't you?  So it's something about creating a balance then.  So in order to be making progress and addressing the depression, you don't have to be on the go all the day.  So how are we going to work?  Let's just recap.  I said there's some new learning that you've kind of discovered recently.  recently.  One is focus on what I have achieved rather than what I haven't.  Keep a routine to the day.  For example, start and finish at the same time.  The third thing you put down is plan for the day ahead the night before.  For example, do a few things well that I can achieve and reflect back on.  And then the fourth element of this kind of routine is to include when you can sit and relax and perhaps do nothing.  Yeah, because that's important, isn't it?  I mean, it's like Sunday, you know, when I was working in hotels and things.  When I had a bit more time to relax, I enjoyed the job more.  That's interesting.  You know, it was... So what is it in this present circumstance then that stops you from sitting down and relaxing?  What do you think has kept you from doing that?  Well, I don't know.  I've ever been very good at relaxing.  Okay.  So it's kind of one of your sort of habits and that's fair enough.  I'm just wondering where you learnt that habit from, what drove you to sort of adopt that really?  Having to be on the go as well, I don't know.  I suppose that is it.  You know, when I was working and I had a full-time job, I was going into work, I was coming home from work, and then it was like work finished and my time off started.  Whereas if I'm sort of at home, working at home a lot, it's very difficult to... I mean, some people have the other problem, don't they, that it's very easy to get distracted by other things and I think it's quite hard being at home all the day because it's very difficult to partition off what's work and what's sort of not.  I mean, I'd be absolutely dreadful at it, I know.  So it's quite hard to be.  what's more disciplined in this is kind of work time and this is leisure time.  But for you, that discernment and that discipline is going to be really important that you have time to set aside where you're focused and constructive and you're trying to achieve something, but also time when you say, this is kind of like me time and time when I can sit down and relax.  Have you been doing any of that then in this last week?  What?  The trying to sort of have the balance between... Yeah, I have.  Okay, what I'm going to suggest we do then... Sometimes, and I've noticed that Can you take me through an example that I think would be really good at this stage, is if we had an example from you, and we'll do what we did before, one of those kind of hot cross bun diagrams, because what we've got so far are diagrams of when things haven't gone well.  I think what would be really nice in contrast is to have formulation that shows when things are going well.  You take me through it, I'll sort of jot down some notes as you go along, and we can do some joining up.  Well, Saturday was quite a good day, because I got up early, nine o'clock, had my breakfast, had a wash, and I went to a church fair up in the high street, St Stephen's Church.  Oh, yeah.  Because I like going to those, you know, brick-a-brack and books.  Yeah, yeah.  You like your cake, don't you?  I share it with Molly.  That's what I do.  You're a man after my own heart.  Every time I see you being out somewhere and you've had tea and cake, I go, yeah, I can identify with that.  So it was Molly's birthday on Saturday.  So as I came back across Cathedral Green, Devon Wildlife Trust, I don't know, I think, you know, like an all-day do.  Oh, yes.  Selling cards.  I've got a birthday card there for Marty.  Mm-hmm.  And I sat down and wrote to her because it was one of these that, you know, you have to write your own message.  Your own messaging, yeah.  And I had to sort of sit and think about what I was going to write.  It was quite good.  So just get me capture that moment with you a minute because I'm not sure what the weather was like on Saturday.  Nice.  It was a nice day.  So you're in Exeter.  I guess there's quite a lot of busyness going around.  There's lots of... You know, I don't like it too busy.  Like if I got there at lunchtime, I'd try to avoid that.  But I noticed that when I went out one night in the evening, it was too quiet.  So let me get you back to this Saturday.  So you've gone along to the church fair.  I want to hear the rest of it in a minute.  I'm just checking myself.  I've got this right.  And you've bought cake, you've gone on to the Cathedral Green, and you've bought a card from Molly, and you're writing that on the Cathedral Green.  I just want you to go back to the moment and try and remember at that stage how you were feeling at that particular time.  Can you... Well, I had things to look forward to.  That was what it was.  Okay, so let's write this down.  If we can, as far as possible, but as being truthful as possible, let's kind of quantify your mood.  Can we give it a name at all?  Is there sort of, say, you know, I was feeling elated or I was feeling energized or I was feeling happy.  What would be the... All of those, I would say.  You tell me in your words how you were feeling.  Well, you know, I was energized because I sort of made the effort to get up early.  Because I like to get up to these prayers as soon as they start, whereas you sometimes miss stuff, you know.  Okay, so you're feeling quite motivated.  Yeah, I was.  Let's just describe your mood.  Let's think of some words.  Excited, okay, brilliant.  I was motivated, excited, expectant.  Yep, yep.  You know how the Dante crime about getting things right.  And if we were going to monitor how excited you were on a scale of nought to a hundred, where would you have put that?  I'm scared of not to a hundred.  Well, I would say eighty-five.  I do like one of these things.  Yeah, I know.  An expectant.  Well, I thought there might be something there.  Get some nice cake.  Get a few books, I thought.  So, in terms of not to a hundred, how expectant were you?  Okay.  So, you're on, you're in Exeter, you're at the church in the Cathedral Green, you're feeling quite excited, you're feeling expectant, you're feeling motivated.  What's going through your mind at this stage?  Can you remember what thoughts there were?  Well, you know, positive, so it's happy thoughts.  Let's try and capture what they were.  I know it's hard because we're a few days down the line now.  Let's try and roughly get the gauge the vague content of what was in them.  What I was thinking about that day, well, it was Molly's birthday as well, so I sort of remembered the night before I got a card for Molly.  Yeah.  So, you know, it was nice to sort of do something for her.  It's nice to do something for Molly.  It's nice to do.  And if you're doing something for Molly, what would that make you think of?  you're sitting there writing out the card thinking about what to write.  in there you bought some cake to share with her.  what does that say about you or your situation?  well i do like doing things for people you know and people are very important to me.  you know i mean the neighbor said that to me one of the other people.  he said um you know he's glad that i'm down there because you know i do a lot.  So when you were thinking about Molly and what you were going to write in her card and sharing cake with her, what came to your mind was that actually your neighbour had commented on how pleased he was that you were there too because the way you think about people.  Well that was the day after, that was on Sunday that Martin mentioned that.  But just thinking about that now, you can remember that you were actually commented that he was pleased to have you there.  Yeah, it was nice to hear things like that.  It's the same with another neighbour who, I knew they'd not been living there very long, probably six months, nine months.  And Chris knew what I was called.  My partner came along the other day, and she called me by my name as well, and I thought, how nice that was.  As I said to her, I said, I don't know your name, and she told me.  So that, you know, I was only thinking this morning, living where I live, it's like being in the village really.  Okay, so you've got kind of a community going on there.  So when you're sat on the Cathedral Green, and you're writing up the card for Morley, You've been expectant that you're going to pick some stuff up that you would like.  You've got some cake to share with her later.  You're feeling quite motivated.  You're doing something nice because it's important to do nice things for people.  What else is going through your mind at this stage?  Anything else?  Any images or ideas?  No, I went to see Eric the day before.  I took some stuff over to him.  No, I just think it was quite a good day.  And I'm the same.  If I'm going for a walk with Mike, it's sort of looking forward to things.  So it's a good day.  So that's fine.  So what I've got here at the moment... Very, very brief snapshot of what you started to tell me.  So you got your Saturday, you got up at nine o'clock.  You went to the church fair, you bought some cake for Molly and a card for Molly while you were out.  You were feeling excited and expectant, eighty-five and ninety percent.  Thinking it's nice to do something for Molly.  I like doing things for people.  People are important.  And it's just made you remember in the session that enabled comment and how pleased they are to have you there.  And you remember thinking at the time, it's a good day.  And that you were feeling quite motivated through that process.  But also when you got up, you were feeling quite motivated too.  I was, yeah.  So when you're feeling motivated, it means you actually got out and did something, didn't it?  And when you were out doing things, it meant you were quite... Yeah.  Motivated.  Yeah.  And when you were having these thoughts about the card and about it being a good day, is it fair to say that your mood was improving as you had those thoughts?  Yeah, I do.  I've noticed before that when I've come home from... walk when I was working, but I'd feel quite high then.  You know, if something had gone well, I'd sort of, you know, come home and drop this stuff, go up to sit in this place.  But it didn't take long for me to sort of fall down again.  Which is what we discussed last time, which is where this kind of next bit comes in.  But for this moment in time, your mood was still feeling quite expectant, quite elated, quite excited, yes, and So you were out and about.  So we've got one of these kind of hot cross buns kind of going around again, haven't we?  Kind of a maintenance cycle.  You tell me, what does this say then about your mood?  You feed that one back to me.  Well, on Saturday, my mood was quite good.  And, you know... I think I've had a better week generally, really.  I mean, going to see Eric, I wanted to slip over and see him, but the thing is with Eric, I've noticed it before, that there isn't a lot coming from him, you know, unless I sort of ask him about something specific, because he's well into computers and televisions and things like that, but otherwise he's not very... He's not a conversation starter.  It's sort of me doing the talking sort of thing, you know.  So taking you back to Saturday?  Yeah.  Okay.  You had this going on in the morning.  Okay, this cycle which kind of was, you know, you were enjoying this.  And what happened after, because you said you usually kind of get back in and your mood can kind of start to wane.  It's okay for a while, but then it wanes.  What did you do differently this time?  Well, I had another fair to go to at St.  David's Church, and I went over there.  I've got a couple of books out there, and a couple of other things.  Okay.  Did some of my shopping on the way back.  Had my lunch between one and two.  Went back up to Tesco to get something.  I listened to sport.  which I usually do if I'm home on a Saturday afternoon.  You know, sometimes football.  On Sunday it was cricket.  Did a bit of washing between four and five.  Did my evening meal.  Read the paper.  Started doing the crossword in the evening.  Okay.  But like I said to you, I'm sort of doing a bit more in the daytime.  It's the evenings really that I don't... do a great deal.  that's the thing I you know.  so this during the day that you did here you've made the effort to go out and do something because you said to me one of the things that you're looking at is to make sure you kind of get up.  at the same time Improve the routine as to what you do.  So for you, going out during the day, is that important?  Oh, it is.  I've got to.  I've sat out today on the seat and had my lunch.  Because I sometimes think, well, it's nice being out in the fresh air and somebody might pass by.  Okay, so even if you've got nothing planned for you, it's quite important just being out because a conversation might strike up or you might see somebody.  Okay, so here you've gone up early, you've gone out and you've had a particularly good time and you've gone on out to do something else and ended up coming home and this is where you notice your mood could start to drop off.  And last time you talked about that, when you got in, your normal thing to do was to start to feel a little bit hopeless and see the things that you hadn't done.  So what was different about this particular time here?  What did you do differently?  Well, I didn't, I came out and I, you know, I've got all the stuff strewn all over the floor and stuff, but I didn't bother about it.  I just sort of sat down and read the paper and And then did the crossword.  So yeah, generally, and then, you know, I was looking forward to, there was cricket on the Sunday then, you know, the Pakistan thing, Sri Lanka, and I did think about going out on the Sunday.  That's the thing, if I go, sometimes if I'm left on my own device or something.  You've said that to me before, so something about planning ahead is difficult.  I said planning ahead is difficult, planning things with people is difficult.  If planning things with people is difficult, it means then that things don't get done.  You don't go out.  So your new learning, you said just now, is that having this routine also includes planning for the day ahead, the night before, to do a few things well that I can achieve and reflect back on.  Now going back to that Saturday, it wasn't dissimilar to the walk that you had when you went up for this walk.  You were feeling very much more energized, you were feeling distracted, your mood was lifted, and then you got home, and then you sort of started getting into sort of hopeless thoughts on not getting things done.  that made you sort of feel tired.  You started to do less and you felt tired, which led to more sort of negative thoughts.  Here you've done something a little bit different and I'm just so keen to find out what it was because you said to me before, I can't plan ahead, whereas obviously you did this time, you did plan ahead, you planned to go out.  And you didn't do it with anybody, you did it on your own.  Yeah, but it was a fairly easy thing to do as well.  Okay.  You know, I didn't have to sort of catch any buses to get there.  But I think, I think that is, something has changed.  I mean, since I talked to you last week about, I was sort of sitting there and thinking, I'm not getting any of this done.  I'm not making any progress.  And after talking to you, I thought, well, not think about that so much.  Think about the things that I have got done.  And maybe, like you said, just deal with it in little pieces.  So, you could easily have slipped back into that, look what I haven't done, but you quite consciously... Yeah.  thought that would just reflect on what I have done.  And you were able to do that I guess because you kept some data on your activity record there as to what you had done.  Yeah?  So you said right at the beginning there's something about writing things down.  that's really important about what you have done.  Yeah, well, I've got to keep on top of it because otherwise it doesn't get done, that's the thing.  So, like I said to you before, if I sort of stop when I'm having a cup of tea at eleven o'clock or something, just write down a couple of things at lunchtime, at tea time.  So when you say write down a couple of things, are you meaning what you've done on your day or from planning ahead?  No, just from what I've done so far that day.  So at morning break, Because otherwise, if you leave it until the evening, I mean, you've almost forgotten really how you were feeling in the morning and things, you know.  Yes.  Yeah.  So, diarising in some form or other is vitally important.  It is because you said to me last week, should I continue doing these?  And I said yes.  into a bit of a pain, I don't know if they're helping, you've got black and white evidence there.  When you're in that moment, you're saying, I haven't got anything done, I'm not achieving anything, you've got your own evidence.  that says, actually, to the contrary, this is what I have been doing.  And the nice thing is that you've been recognising it's good to stop at certain times of the day and have a brief reflection.  Now, if you get to lunchtime and you think, okay, what have I done?  and you really haven't really done anything productive, what will that help you then to do?  If you have these points in the day when you sit and reflect.  Well, it might help me to do a bit more.  Yeah.  Because, you know, otherwise it's too easy to sort of go through a day and not do very much at all.  specific things to do in the day and do that, I might do that a little bit more as well.  Absolutely.  The important thing is to get this kind of structure.  Now for you, what would a good structure look like?  Because we don't want to do something which is totally unachievable, but we don't want to do something where you can also slip back into the old things.  So the kind of way I think about it is, it's out of grasp, but it's not out of reach.  Yeah, so I think you just have to sort of strain a bit before, but it's not so far away that you'll never get it.  What would a really good day that would keep you going look like?  Well, it's something I need to do because I'm eating more and I need to be exercising more because otherwise I'll just kind of get cut around the middle.  So... You know, if I sort of go for a walk on my own, as long as I don't have to leave too early.  And if I have to leave at half past ten, I could manage that.  If I have to be up to catch a bus at quarter to nine, I'm not going to do it.  Okay, so let's be realistic.  You said to me when I phoned you up to make your initial appointment, I'm not very good in the mornings at this stage, okay.  So we need to work with what we've got.  You're trying to get up at a reasonable time now, so you're setting yourself up a time to get up by.  So if you say, I'm going to be out of the house by such and such a time, let's say ten-thirty, that's reasonable for you.  Well, I woke up this morning at half-eight.  And I didn't want to wake up at quarter past nine.  Because as I said, sometimes I sort of wake up at half-eight and I don't like lying there.  It's better if I get up.  One of the important things with depression, and you're starting to recognize this, is creating a getting up routine.  And that's regardless of whether you feel you really want to do it or not.  And people have noticed tremendous gains just by making sure that if they set their alarm clock that they get up at that particular time.  And you might feel tired because you haven't had a good night's sleep.  You may feel you want to sleep on.  But actually getting up, contracting yourself to get up and dressed and going by a time, it's really important with depression.  So that's, you know, you're obviously starting to recognize that.  Make sure it starts and finishes at the same time.  Fight for it, that will also help you sleep.  Yeah.  And if I do choose, I might go for a walk tomorrow.  I don't have to get up too early.  If I get a bus at just after ten o'clock, I can manage that.  Okay, so a good day for you.  I said to you, if you don't sit and reflect, what's the problem?  If I don't do anything, because I go through the whole day without doing anything.  It's very easy that the days slip by.  Absolutely.  So the question to you was, what does a What would a day that you feel that you could achieve look like?  And he said, well, one of the things you're doing is attending to your diet.  You're eating better.  That's really good.  Very fundamental thing that can be easily overlooked is good eating habits.  I've been eating a lot of fruit and vegetables.  Okay.  Food is your body's fuel.  It's a bit like a car.  Yeah.  You know, if a car that drives an unleaded and you put diesel in it, you put the wrong fuel in it, it's not going to work, is it?  Or if it's lead propane stuff or whatever and you put in four star, it isn't going to work.  The same way your body doesn't work without the right kind of fuel in it.  And it'll tend to get sluggish, it'll slow down, it won't be as effective.  People find things like the concentration, the memory gets smuggled, you can't remember.  I do feel better, I mean, because I, you know... I used to buy sometimes ready meals because it was something quick.  Sure.  And I haven't done that for a long time.  So you're eating more fruit?  Yeah.  Yeah.  And what else are you eating?  Vegetables.  Okay, that's great.  So less ready meals.  I don't buy ready meals at all either.  tea after about eight o'clock at night.  Good, because that will perfect your sleep.  I've always washed them sometimes on the dozer, you know, because it's just a drink I want and you don't have to have tea all the time.  This is really important and I think what I'm going to encourage you to do, this may seem like some very small changes and fairly insignificant, But I don't know whether we used the analogy last time of cooking and ingredients.  But if you're making a cake, I say a sponge cake, it needs self-raising flour.  Yeah?  It works with the eggs to make it nice and big and puffy.  If you put in plain flour, it hasn't got the raising agent in it.  It doesn't matter if you add it to eggs or not, it'll just stay some flat thing.  With depression, it's about having... the right ingredients.  And baking powder is just a tiny little ingredient in the flour, just a minute amount, but it's enough to react with the egg to make it nice and big and fluffy and light.  This is the same.  You might think it's really insignificant, the eating, but actually something very small and significant can make a huge change in another area.  So physiologically, people who don't eat well do get tired and lethargic.  Concentration's impaired.  Yeah, they actually feel bloated sometimes.  It can make you feel bloated, it can make you feel shaky and sick.  I mean, it has lots of connotations.  But don't underestimate it.  So what I'm going to ask you to do, when you're doing these thought records in your head, working through about what you've achieved, I'm going to ask you to really trawl through all the evidence, no matter how small it is.  So if you sat and thought, I haven't done anything today, I haven't done anything productive.  Ah, but I did cook myself a meal.  I would have done that a few weeks ago.  Well, that is it.  I mean, I do make an effort to sort of, you know, I don't do it every day.  I make a casserole and I'll sort of have it today and tomorrow and put a couple in the freezer, yeah.  Good.  And those are the kind of things I want you to start to... draw your attention to when you're thinking about things that you've done.  It's so easy to overlook.  Eating at regular times is another thing, isn't it?  Okay.  I used to find sometimes that I'd go and I'd have something to eat at lunch at three o'clock or something.  That's another important point.  Again, it's important to eat regularly.  You don't put the fuel into your body regularly.  It goes into a kind of slow down move at the moment to preserve the calories that you've got.  So it shuts down, it doesn't metabolize very quickly, so again you'll feel sluggish.  Well I went out of town one day and I don't know, I was getting out my bread or something and I think I You won't do.  Basically what your body does is it starts to kind of slow itself down and it takes calories from the protein in your muscles and it can make you feel quite shaky, quite unwell, quite light headed.  A bit faint.  A bit faint, that's right.  So eating regularly, as much as eating well is important.  So eating one good meal a day is no substitute for having regular small meals every day.  So feeding yourself regularly, especially if you're going to be exercising.  That's another thing, because I don't think, you know, when I was walking a lot, that I was eating enough.  Sure.  Absolutely.  So all these things go together.  So we're starting to get together a new plan of action as to what you think the new Charlie's gonna look like.  So far, we've got focus on what you've achieved rather than what you haven't.  Keep a routine to the day, starting to finish at the same time.  Plan for the day ahead the night before.  Better to do a few things well and reflect back on them.  including times that you can sit down and relax, because you've never been good at that anyway.  But morning, break, and at lunch write down what I've done, otherwise you'll forget come the evening.  If I don't sit and reflect, I may go through the day without doing anything.  It tends to my diet, for example, more fruit and veg, no more ready meals, reduced tea intake, exercise, and eat regularly.  Do you know with the food, this last year, how I said to a couple of people that, you know, because I started enjoying my food more and tasting things, you know, whereas before it was just like, you know, something to fill a gap and I just, you know, stopped.  So if you're actually focusing... On food that's good for you, food that you would like to eat, are you more or less likely going to enjoy the food than if you buy something just for the sake of it?  Oh, yeah, of course.  You know, it's like in the morning, I have brownies on chocolate and a bit of banana with it, you know, because it's nicer, you know.  So buying and eating food that you like... Mm-hmm.  a long time and that was nice you know.  yeah so simple things which kind of can always seem insignificant.  yeah when you're well you know because you just do it so easily overlooked when you get depressed and you kind of get into this rut don't you of sort of a downward spiral very quickly just overlooking basic essentials like buying and eating food that i like eating regularly, eating proper food that's good fuel, yes?  So those things are really important and I'd really encourage you that when you're thinking about your day and reflecting on your day, that you include the smallest of details in that because they are big achievements.  Yeah, well I think a lot of things go really, I mean, you know, the way that you think about yourself as well and the way that you dress and about your dressing.  i mean um that sounds terrible.  um you know it's very easy isn't it?  to sort of.  i guess i mean i'm talking for a woman's perspective here not from a man's but you know lots of people.  i see they'll just wear sort of similar things day and day without putting too much time and effort to their appearance.  is that sort of similar to kind of what you're experiencing?  well i used to be talking one time because i used to buy a lot more clothes.  you know I don't think I bother about that so much these days.  I mean, this is really cheering me up.  Because I know that I will sort of get walking again.  So in order to do the job, you need the right tools, basically, isn't it?  Yeah, if you haven't got the tools, then you're going to have difficulty doing the.  I think that's what I need to do.  I need to eat more.  I need to exercise more.  And then you need to plan that in a routine style, don't you?  Not just wait for it to happen.  You can wait for it to happen.  Of course you can.  It's not good.  If I sort of plan it, like you say, it'll happen more quickly.  More likely to happen.  So we've got eleven points here.  The things that you've found to be important.  We've got just a very small snapshot of how some of those things put together, because this was a planned thing, wasn't it?  Again, you kind of got up, as you said, you planned it, you kind of went out and did it, you sort of had some good positive thoughts that went through your mind, yes?  So you went home and instead of focusing on what you hadn't done, you continued to do things that you perhaps liked rather than thinking you've got to go and do chores, yes?  You know, you started to put together some of the ideas, and you're not going to put all eleven points together all at the same time, but obviously, you know, it's like with anything, you know, there's ten ways to make a fruitcake, there's ten ways to make someone less depressed, you know, it's never going to be the same kind of twice.  So it's about saying, okay, have I got the right ingredients today?  If I put, you know, have I got enough of everything there?  You know, what cake do I want to look like today?  I'll make my Christmas cake.  if I look around and there's so many different recipes.  We've all got something slightly different in, in different quantities.  And it's a bit like that.  Okay, have I got the essential ingredients in there in the right quantities?  My diet used to be a bit like that, it used to be either or, you know.  And it's sometimes, you know, if you sort of do something new, it's, you know.  Yeah.  So good thinking then about moving on.  Let's just hold this, let's just, we need to think about some goals now, what they're going to look like.  What are you taking away from this bit of the session?  What's some learning points?  How would you summarize it?  Well, you know, this last six weeks, well, I think it's been really useful to me.  I feel that it's been more helpful just taking the medication on my own.  I said that to my doctor when I saw him back on the fourth of June.  And, you know, some of the things that I need to do, like, you know, allowing myself time in the evening to relax and, you know, have a little bit more of a social life perhaps.  And to sort of plan things more on a weekly basis about going out walking.  Even, you know, if I've got a friend, you know, there's places where I can go where there won't be people around.  So it's good to start from where you feel familiar and to get going again.  I could have gone out on my own for a walk.  And now I think, well, you know, I could jump on a bus and go somewhere.  And I think if I got there, then I would probably go for a little walk.  So it's... It's just moving slightly out of the comfort zone, isn't it?  Yeah.  I can move out of the comfort zone for a walk on my own.  So we got some new learning and we got some action points here.  Do you think there's enough on here to kind of keep you going for the next few sessions in terms of Things that you will be able to act upon.  I don't know if you can read my line of writing.  Well, some of these things I've been doing, like eating properly.  Oh yeah, well, I know there's still a couple of things that I need to get filled out.  But so I go to the walking shop and sort that out.  Got their friends over there.  I was talking to the women on Saturday about doing something every year.  Like for me, you know, like doing a walk, you know, because Mike was talking about walking in Sunset about... And, you know, if we did that every year, we could maybe raise some money for charity as well.  I get the sense often that when you're out doing things, then one thing often tends to lead to another and to another.  Yeah.  You take those opportunities.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Well, that is it.  I think it's sort of talking about things with other people sometimes, you know.  You know, we could do the canal in Somerset and his wife could drop us off and do this for lunch.  So there's enough points there to be getting on with, is there?  Yeah, I think so.  In terms of your goals?  Yeah.  Okay.  I don't know how the time is.  Oh, we're at ten to.  We're just coming to an end now.  So what we'll do then is I'll get those copied over the road to you from the photocopier.  Yeah, sure.  So we've got enough goals to be moving on with.  Is it... that you want to make another six sessions then and see where we head with these?  Yeah.  Yeah?  Okay.  So, what do you want to do now?  Do you want to sort of have a little break?  No, we carry straight on.  We'll carry straight on into the next six sessions.  So we'll block book another six.  Because it's summer and I'm sort of off and on here for the next few weeks, there may be a gap of a week sometimes between.  That's your new BVI for next time.  Have you got a pen and paper there to book some more dates?  No, I think you're right.  If I did have a little break, it's very easy to fall back again.  It is.  So we'll book another six sessions that will run as consecutively as we can.  For the first one, are you able to make slightly earlier in the day than three o'clock now?  Right, yeah.  I've got an appointment next Wednesday the first at two thirty?  Yeah, okay.  Wednesday the first of July, is that okay for you?  Yep.  Yep, okay.  Now, this is where the gap is going to occur.  I'm not going to be around for that week, unless we can make Friday the tenth of July.  Could you make Friday the tenth?  Yeah, um, eleven thirty?  Yeah, okay, be brave.  There we shall go.  I usually like to try and keep people at the same time, so it's not gonna be possible, unfortunately.  Thursday the thirtieth of July, one o'clock.  Thursday the sixth of August at one o'clock.  Thursday the thirteenth.  Could you do twelve thirty?  That would be the eleventh session.  And hopefully everyone arose then.  And then Thursday the It's the twentieth of August at one o'clock.  That'll be session twelve.  We'll see how we go.  It may be that that will be the last session, but we'll plan for that beforehand anyway.  We'll just see how it goes.  It may mean that you need the whole eighteen sessions, or somewhere between twelve and eighteen.  But generally go up to twelve.  Okay.  So anything to ask about the homework?  You're going to be focusing on some of these goals.  Yes.  And what goals in particular?  One of the things I know I need to do is eat more and exercise more.  I'm going to go out for a walk tomorrow.  I might do... six miles on my own you know because that's the thing it's like.  i said to you that um you know i used to think ten miles no problem.  and then you stop doing it and you think i don't know whether i'll be able to do it and if i do start walking a little bit further.  so You're going to attend to the walking and the eating in particular, setting your routine, trying to keep to it and plan to the day ahead.  And the way you're going to do that is to continue with your daily monitoring activity schedule, yeah?  Keeping tabs on it and having some daily reflection.  At least twice a day on that.  And if I don't go for a walk, then I'll sort of plan something to do.  And if I plan two things to make sure I do it, then maybe I'll do a little bit more as well.  And I think that's important.  If you planned it, you must make sure you do it, regardless of how you feel about it.  Okay.  Well, it sounds really positive to me what you're doing.  Some really positive changes there.  Some really good discoveries.  And, you know, I'm just going to look forward to seeing how this goes over the next few weeks.  And we've got a plan of action.  Okay.  You've got the dates.  You've got the VDI.  I've got that I'm going to copy.  \n\nBe sure to include detailed reasoning and justification for your answer. \nRemember that unless all of the criteria for a certain score are met, you cannot give the therapist that score.\nYou must provide a final score out of6 in the format x\/6.\n",
      "ctsr_assessment": "The therapist demonstrated good skills in agenda setting and adherence during this session. The session began with a review of the client's BGI scores, which provided an opportunity to discuss progress and identify areas for further focus. The therapist encouraged the client to reflect on their achievements and set specific goals for the day, such as focusing on positive changes and maintaining routines. However, while there was collaboration in setting the agenda, it could have been more explicit and prioritized. Additionally, the session touched on several topics without always adhering strictly to the initial plan, which may have led to some tangential discussions. Overall, the therapist showed competence with minor inconsistencies, earning a score of 4\/6."

        "description": "You are a therapist competency assessor for Cognitive Behavioural Therapists. You provide an assessment of therapist competencies when given a transcript of a Cognitive Behavioural Therapy session between a client and therapist. You assess therapists on the following criterion, \"Agenda Setting and Adherence\". A detailed mark scheme is provided below.  \n\nScoring system \nA detailed explanation of the scoring system is provided below. As you can see, each item is rated on a Likert scale, ranging from 0-6. Each level being defined in detail to conform to the levels of competence (see Table 2). \n\nExample of the scoring layout: \n\nKey features: this is an operationalised description of the item (see examples within the CTS-R). \n\nCompetence level Examples \n0 = Absence of feature, or highly inappropriate performance \n1 = Inappropriate performance, with major problems evident \n2 = Evidence of competence, but numerous problems and lack of consistency \n3 = Competent, but some problems and\/or inconsistencies \n4 = Good features, but minor problems and\/or inconsistencies \n5 = Very good features, minimal problems and\/or inconsistencies \n6 = Excellent performance, or very good even in the face of patient difficulties \n\nPlease note that the top marks (i.e. near the 'expert' end of the continuum) are reserved for those therapists demonstrating highly effective skills, particularly in the face of difficulties (i.e. highly aggressive or avoidant patients; high levels of emotional discharge from the patients; and various situational factors). Maximum score on the scale is 72 (12 x 6). At the Newcastle Cognitive Therapy Centre we set a minimum competence standard of 36, which would be an average of 3 marks per item. \n\nItem 1 - Agenda Setting and Adherence \nIntroduction\nThe agenda helps ensure that the most important issues are addressed in an efficient manner. Therapist and patient must establish these issues jointly. The agenda should review items from the previous session(s), in particular the homework assignment, and include one or two items for the session. Once set, it should be appropriately adhered to. However, if changes are necessary, because of an important new issue arising, the deviation from the agenda should be made explicit. \n\nThe key features of the 'agenda' is outlined in the CTS-R Rating Scale as follows: \nKey features: To address adequately topics that have been agreed and set in an appropriate way. This involves the setting of discrete and realistic targets collaboratively. The format for setting the agenda may vary according to the stage of therapy - see manual. Three features need to be considered when scoring this item: \n(i) presence\/absence of an agenda which is explicit, agreed and prioritised, and feasible in the time available; \n(ii) appropriateness of the contents of the agenda (to stage of therapy, current concerns etc.), a standing item being a review of the homework set previously;\n(iii) appropriate adherence to the agenda. \n\nNB: Agenda setting requires collaboration and credit for this should be given here, and here alone. Collaboration occurring at any other phase of the session should be scored under Item 3 (Collaboration).\n\nShort-term cognitive therapy requires that the important issues are discussed sensitively but managed in a business-like way. In order to cover a lot of material adequately in a relatively short space of time, specific and realistic targets need to be set in a collaborative manner, and adhered to appropriately. Indeed, it is of limited use to set a good agenda and then not be guided by it. On setting the agenda the therapist must ensure the items are appropriate. They should be suitable for the stage of therapy, amenable to a CT rationale, consistent with the formulation, and conceived to take the therapy forward. In addition, the items should be clear and discrete. If the items are too vague, this may lead to confusion and also result in divergent and tangential material being discussed. It is important to note, however, that the therapist must be aware not to let the patient go into too much detail about any one item at this stage, as this will disrupt the agenda setting process. The therapist must be careful not to include too many items, as this may lead to either important items being missed or the therapy being rushed. \n\nThe list of items should include material from both the patient and therapist. A discussion of the homework which was set previously should be a 'standing' item. Even when no homework was set in the previous session (for whatever reason), the value of such assignments should be discussed in order to restate the importance of this aspect of therapy. Unless this is done the patient may come to think that there is no need to complete the assignment carefully. Part of socialising the patient to CT is to establish an expectation that he\/she will need to come to each session having thought through the key topics for that day's therapeutic work. \n\nFollowing the setting of the agenda, the patient should be asked to prioritise his\/her list of items. The prioritisation permits the therapist to plan the session and allot appropriate time for the material. Efficient prioritising facilitates the pacing of the therapy.\n \nCHECKLIST: QUESTIONS FOR RATERS TO ASK THEMSELVES:\n1. Did the therapist set an agenda with clear, discrete, and realistic goals - and adhere to it? \n2. Can you identify at least two specific agenda items? \n3. Was the patient encouraged to participate in setting the agenda? \n4. Do you think the patient clearly understood what the therapy was going to cover? \n5. Did the agenda seem appropriate? \n6. Were the items prioritised? \n7. Was the session set sensitively? \n8. Did you hear any of the following: \n- What would you like to get from today's session? \n- As usual at the beginning of the session, we need to set a plan. \n- What benefits do you think we get by setting the agenda? \n- Perhaps we need to put some time for X. \n- What is the most important thing to cover today? ... Are there any other things to include? \n- Is there anything that has been troubling you this week, which might help to illustrate your problems? \n- You have mentioned X, Y and Z. Which of these would you like to talk about first? \n- If we did discuss this item, how would it help take the therapy forward? \n- What would be most helpful to discuss today, keeping in mind the stage weâre at in therapy? \n- By discussing X, how will this help us move forward? \n\nRemember this mark scheme as you will shortly be asked to assess a transcript using the above criteria.\n"
